<h3>WELCOME</h3>
<p>Jesus loves YOU and so do we in Jesus name, were excited you chose to worship together with us in truth and Spirit with the Holy Spirit power. Together we are praying and expecting for miracles, signs, and wonders each night during the Revival nights to allow the Lord to move in his own way and his own will to be done on earth as it is in heaven with his people in much need.</p>

(Mathew 6:10  KJV)<br>
10 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.<br>

<p>We hope you come expecting for a miracle from the Lord, something to get excited about.</p>

(Matthew 17:20 KJV)<br>
20 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.<br>
