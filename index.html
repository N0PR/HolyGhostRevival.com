<h3>Water Baptism</h3>

<p>Baptism is something to celebrate! Water Baptism is the public expression of your decision to follow Jesus. If you’ve never been water baptized or would like to recommit your life to God and be re-baptized, just mention this to our team at the check-in table when you arrive at the Revival Nights event so we can be prepared for you.</p>

<p>Guests who come to the Revival Night with interested in water baptism are encouraged to bring an extra set of clothes and a towel. Please plan to dress modestly. We ask that no excessively short (mid-thigh) cut off shorts, dresses or swimsuits to be worn in the baptism tank... Darker shirts, shorts and pants/jeans are okay. </p>

<p>Towels are very limited at this time so please bring your own. </p>

<p>Public restrooms will be available nearby for changing into dry clothes.</p>

<p><em>Matthew 3:11 KJV- I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance. but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:</em></p>
